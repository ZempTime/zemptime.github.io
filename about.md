### More Information

Let say I built a boat from the dump. Now it's pretty decent boat  in terms or its purpose. I pieced it together from here and there or at least I think so because it's mine. When I ask for my friends to go for a ride... They bring their power drills and start trying to put holes in my boat. I have built an armada of boats than now lurk in the metaphorical Pearl Harbor of my head. It sounds depressing and I need to find new friends. in reality I need less of the people who just tell me its great because it looks ok. Thats the same asshole standing on the beach while I'm sinking yelling " I thought you had it bro". That guy is useless to me.  When in long run I'm better off with the people who attempt to ruin the boat because if it hold then its truly sea worthy. And then you'd ask me where am I going to sail to? I was working this whole time to find out I was always heading for where I started.

If you came here looking for a solution to a specific problem then you will miss the concept. We do not claim to have figured this out, we will never tell you anything we expect you to take and absolute truth. We will never ask for your password1. We are a conglomerate of different backgrounds and subject matter .... Honestly were just post grads and professional going through a unique transition phase where we are just trying to be ok. In our conception of time, we now have no direction but our own will. That all modern people, yet we think the world is glossing over the fact that we are a generation of digital  rodeo clowns. Yet there is a some different this time around. instead of asking questions to learn. We have the cheat sheet to life with search engines. Now the bigger question is what do I ask or why or how or X, Y, Z.  I would say it started as more of a sport at first. Then our competitive nature began manifesting pretty good shit. being not afraid to destroy each others ideas (boats) we can attempt to shit idk.... that's the point. If we only ask questions for an expect answer then we are by definition insane. "Doing the same thing over and over again is the definition of in nation - enshrine bithces. 

in short. Im lost but I'm not too worried. because I don't know where I was going to start. and that place that I set for ... well at this point I'm not sure where I was.... fuck you apple maps. 

You will never get there 

PSA from a bunch of alcoholics who are in denial because no one like a quitrer.  yeah were looking at you mister "I have my shit together. " well mines spilled out on the pavement but at least I know what I have you prick.
