Some information about you!

### More Information 

Let say I built a boat from the dump. Now it's pretty decent boat in terms of its purpose. I pieced it together from here and there or at least I think so because it's mine. When I ask for my friends to go for a ride... They bring their power drills and start trying to put holes in my boat. I have built an armada of boats than now lurk in the metaphorical Pearl Harbor of my head. It sounds depressing and I need to find new friends.

In reality I need less of the people who just tell me its great because it looks OK. That is the same asshole standing on the beach while I'm sinking yelling _"I thought you had it bro_". That guy is useless to me. In long run I'm better off with the people who attempt to ruin the boat because if it hold then its truly sea worthy. And then you'd ask me,  where am I going to sail to? ...  Was working this whole time to find out I was actually always heading for where I started? 

**If you came here looking for a solution to a specific problem then you will miss the concept.** 

We do not claim to have figured this out, we will never tell you anything we expect you to take and absolute truth. We will never ask for your password1. We kind of like to run with the idea of: Avoid people who claim they have found truth and seek out people who are still looking. Not long ago i thought my cup had a hole in it but really it was overflowing. I was blind, and im not going to say now i see. Im slowly learning that life is about self evaluation. 

We are a conglomerate of different backgrounds and subject matte .... Honestly were just post grads and professional going through a unique transition phase where we are just trying to be OK or enough. 

In our conception of time, we now have no direction but our own power will. 

We are a generation of digital rodeo clowns. We are sending every ranch-hand with a gun to solve problems that require a real cowboy. 

**_There is a some different this time around_**

 instead of asking questions to learn or to better yourself. We have the cheat sheet to life with search engines and browsers. Now the bigger question is **what do I ask or why or how or X, Y, Z**. 

I would say it started as more of a sport at first. Then our competitive nature began manifesting pretty good shit. Not being afraid or having mutual respect to destroy each others ideas (boats) we can attempt to be better (more on this later)

If we only ask questions for an expected answer then we are by definition insane. "Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results is insanity - Albert E. (general gist)

In short.

I am lost but, I'm not too worried, because I don't know where I was going to start with and that place that I set for ... well at this point I'm not sure where I was.... fuck you apple maps.

You may never get there, but if you do send me a post card. I hope there is beer. 

PSA from a bunch of alcoholics who are in denial because no one likes a quitter.  yeah were looking at you mister "I have my shit together. " well my shit is spilled out on the pavement, but at least I know what I have to pick up.
