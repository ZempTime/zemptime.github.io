title: Simple Theory of the Bible
---

The Bible is the story of you told from a third-person perspective. You are God - you consist of the body, the mind, and the spirit. You are the observer, the actor, and the camera.

Rather than a set of literal stories which have happened (although they likely have some basis in reality), the Bible serves as a map of the human mind and journey in narrative form. The Bible is a tool, and this vantage point is it's intended use.

God says I am everywhere, I know everything, I know when everything happened, I am everything and I've created everything - well in my world, that's me. In your world, that's you. They told us straight up but it was so absurb we assumed it was a parable.

## All right then, who is Jesus?

Jesus is you. Jesus is the avatar you continually create in the video game of existence. The Bible is what will happen. God is the context of your experience.

## What are miracles?

All of a sudden, miracles like "walking on water" make sense. Of _course_ you're going to sound like a badass in your own story! (Turning water into wine = party move!?)

What walking on water is is the idea that you can become better than you think you are. Which is the hardest part of any major change: committing to the idea that it's possible.

When you're sitting on the couch 12 beers in on a week night, the right question is: how did I get here? How might I walk on water? Did he? Can he? (meaning you?)

Now, once you have your answer, ask yourself: are you just giving yourself an answer to the question you want? Or is your answer really your answer because you don't want to start believing you could change because it sounds impossible?

If you believe you can, then you will walk on water. If you don't believe you can, then you will sink. That's a damn useful metaphor.

## Religious Texts, in General

Religious texts are a codec of the human mind. They're a map, laid out in narratives, in a form which they can survive time. Why did the Bible survive? It got attention beause it's truthful. It stayed because it was secularly useful. So it serves as a trojan horse of truth.

In this sense, all religious texts are derived from the same source material. They variate when buffeted against different periods and contexts in human history.

## Why this is a good theory, and how to test it

Outlined above is the basis of a theory. 

**What makes a good theory:** A theory can explain something and make predictions where, when you vary parts of the theory, the predictions indicated by the theory change. The harder a theory is to vary, the better it is. Prediction is knowledge. Theories make predictions. Theories create knowledge.

**Blurring correctly**: Do you know why a pot of water boils? If you studied the individual molecules in a pot of water down at the molecular level of granularity, it would be quite hard to piece it all together. But when you blur all the molecules into a single thing - the water in a pot - it becomes possible to reason about it effectively and usefully. You can fairly accurately calculate how much heat it would take to make that pot of water boil. You can then also go from the top-down, from the notion of the entire pot of water down to the individual molecules. And then, using your theory at the blurred level of the pot of water, you can begin to make more sensible predictions about how the water molecules will behave.

As of right now, we've blurred the idea of the Bible to a higher level, so we can adequately explain it not in terms of the individual stories, but as a single tool.

It would be interesting to build a narrative mapping of texts across religions.
